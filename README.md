## About

This repository contains lab assignments and practice exercises from the client-side (front-end) portion of the ITI full-stack curriculum. The goal is to build a strong foundation in web technologies, starting from HTML & CSS and advancing into JavaScript.  

## Structure

Here’s how the repo is organized:

- The **html&css** folder holds early labs focusing on layout, tags, styling, responsive basics, etc.  
- The **html5_css3** folder includes labs diving into HTML5 semantics, CSS3 effects, transitions, animations, etc.  
- The **js** folder contains JavaScript assignments: DOM manipulation, events, fetch APIs, etc.


## How to Use / Run Labs

1. Clone or fork this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedmohamedezz/ITI_clientside_course_labs.git
   ```
2. Open the lab folder you want (e.g. html&css/) in your editor or file explorer.

3. Open the HTML file(s) in your browser.  
  - Many labs can run by simply opening index.html in browser.
  - Some labs may require running from a local server (due to module imports, fetch, etc.).
